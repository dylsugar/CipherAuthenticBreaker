This one was difficult. It took me 4 hrs just to get the right words for the plaintext. I first singled out the individual letters and deduced those to vowels. Like the first letter by itself could only be an "i" or an "a" conventionally speaking. The rest I had to just guess trial and error. On piazza, one of the students pointed out clif kid jbars/zbars, so I tested those. Once getting those, I was able to make words and confirm some mappings. However, most of the process also included guessing words that could potentially fit and if it complied with the confirmed mappings. So... after getting the mapping, my brain was completely racked, so I spent a while being confused the order to put the mapping and how the indexes would relate alphabet a-z.
